## üóÑÔ∏è Dataset Files

The following raw datasets were used to build the database and perform analysis. All files are located in the [`/data`](./data) folder:

| File                                            | Description                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`product_sales.csv`](./data/product_sales.csv) | Transactional sales records, including revenue and product identifiers |
| [`Product_data.csv`](./data/Product_data.csv)   | Product metadata including names, categories, and price points         |
| [`discount_data.csv`](./data/discount_data.csv) | Monthly discount bands and corresponding discount rates                |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Resolutions

### Challenge 1: Data Aggregation from Multiple Sources

The sales, product, and discount data were stored separately and needed to be linked to extract meaningful insights.

**Resolution:**  
Used SQL joins to combine tables based on `Discount_Band` and `Month` to calculate adjusted revenue and discount performance.

---

### Challenge 2: Data Cleaning & Formatting

Some data inconsistencies and formatting issues affected visualization accuracy in Power BI.

**Resolution:**  
Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query Editor**, ensured consistent data types, handled nulls, and reshaped tables for better analysis.

---

### Challenge 3: Year-on-Year Profit Calculations

Comparing profits across years required additional logic and transformation.

**Resolution:**  
Created calculated columns and measures using **DAX** to compute Year-over-Year (YoY) Profit and visualize growth trends over time.

---

## üîç Recommendations

Based on the insights generated from the Power BI dashboard:

1. **Reevaluate Discount Strategies**  
   High discount bands reduce revenue significantly. Consider smaller, targeted discounts to optimize profitability.

2. **Focus on High-Performing Product Bands**  
   Allocate marketing resources to bands that consistently outperform others in sales and revenue.

3. **Improve Seasonal Planning**  
   Identify monthly performance peaks and align inventory, promotions, and sales strategies accordingly.

4. **Bundle Low-Performing Products**  
   Increase the visibility of underperforming products through bundling or targeted campaigns.

5. **Add Regional/Channel-Level Analysis in Future**  
   Enhance the analysis with regional dimensions or customer segments for more granular insights.
